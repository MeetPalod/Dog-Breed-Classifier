# Dog-Breed-Classifier
A CNN trained to determine the dog breed based on the face provided in an image

## Project Overview

It's the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) project in the Deep Learning Nanodegree program of Udacity. I learned how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm identifies an estimate of the dog's breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code identifies the resembling dog breed.
